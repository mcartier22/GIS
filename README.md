# GIS
Repository of past GIS work and presentations

The majority of these figures explore business and employment trends on the Northside of Minneapolis. My
Urban GIS Class partnered with a local NGO, the Northside Achievement Zone, working in this underserved 
community. Our goal was to help provide a broader narrative of neighborhood conditions in order to inform
the organization's planning and decision making. The individual figures in this repository are the maps that
I created to contribute to this project, and I have also included an informational pamphlet I developed. I 
uploaded the entire final document and presentation, as well, so you can see how my work fit in to the larger
project.

I have also included two presentations completed for different geography courses. In one, my partners and I 
neighborhood change over 10 years around a new light rail line to determine if it had caused gentrification
in the area. In the other presentation, I examined the affects that the formalization of the transit system
in Lima, Peru, would have on informal vendor markets, which included GIS analysis.
